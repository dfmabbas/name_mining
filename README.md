I built this script for my own needs, **maybe you need it**.

The names are produced on the basis of the first ‍‍`seeds`, which are very special grains.

What are the names made for use in what is useful?
‍‍`username`
`password`
`Unicorn and non-repetitive name`
`Product names and projects`
and ... :)



##### How to use it?

```bash
python3 mining.py
```



**Note :** If you encounter an error, find and ‍`deactivate` the following line in the source code.

```python
os.system(f"say {name}")
```
